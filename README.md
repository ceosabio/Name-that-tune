# [Name that tune] Proposal

## What is [Name that tune]?

(Brief description of the game, why you're choosing to make it)
Name that tune is a game where a user can play a clip of a song and choose from a list of songs, which song actually played.  I choose to create this game because alothough I'm not into computer games, this was a show on tv when I was younger that I always remembered and thought would be cool to implement.

## Wireframe

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)
Wireframes where actually a sketch of the interface in different states.  I have the pics but not sure how to place them into this document.

## Initial thoughts on game structure

(Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with)
Plenty on the production side but regarding the coding; I forsee difficulty in creating questions and multiple choice questions that load up dynamically and scores the user as s/he plays the game.

## Phases of Completion

(The steps or phases you expect to go through, and the tasks that you'll need to accomplish to reach each step. These should resemble the acceptance criteria we were working through earlier.)
Create the interface
Plan out the game play
code the game, starting with having the information dynamically load into the html.

## Links and Resources

(Anything you've looked up so far or are thinking about using. Links to repo and project board)
I used various websites, couldnt keep track of all of them as many of them lead me to alot of dead ends.  Used a few books to explain various concepts as well.  Recieved some much needed help from Aaron our squad leader.
