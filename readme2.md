    options: ["All About the Benjamins", "O.P.P.", "C.R.E.A.M."],
    correctAnswer: "O.P.P." 
    }, {
    song: "It_Was_A_Good_Day.mp3",
    options: ["It Was a Good Day", "God's Plan", "Fight the Power"],
    correctAnswer: "It was a Good Day"
    }, {
    song: "California_Love.mp3",
    options: ["In Da Club", "Bodak Yellow", "California Love"],
    correctAnswer: "California Love"
